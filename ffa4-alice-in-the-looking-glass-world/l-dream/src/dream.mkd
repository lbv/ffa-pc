And so, we reach the end of the Alice's story. In the closing poem, we can
see that many words end with a common sequence of letters (that is, they
have a common *suffix*), mainly for rhyming purposes.

For this problem, your task is to write a program that analyses a block of
text (like a poem, for example), and can answer to queries of three types.
Given an arbitrary suffix **S**, we are interested in the following queries:

* What was the first word in the text with the suffix $S$?
* What was the last word in the text with the suffix $S$?
* How many words in the whole text have the suffix $S$?

The queries are case--insensitive (a lowercase **x** matches an uppercase
**X**, for example).

## Input ##

Input starts with a positive integer **T**, that denotes the number of test
cases ($T \leq 10$).

Each test case starts with a blank line. The next line contains an integer
**M** that represents the amount of lines of text to analyse. The following
$M$ lines contain arbitrary text that can include whitespaces and any
printable character. The maximum length for any line of text is 10,000
characters.

$1 \leq M \leq 10$

All lines of text contain between 1 and 30 words. A word is a sequence of 1
or more consecutive alphabetic characters (lowercase or uppercase). Any
non-alphabetic character (including punctuation marks) must be considered as
whitespace. Every word will have a length between 1 and 250 (inclusive).

After the lines of text comes an integer **Q** in a single line, denoting the
number of queries to process.

$1 \leq Q \leq 300$

The following $Q$ lines contain a query of the form **Type Suffix** where
"Type" can be one of three alternatives:

* **F** - Asks for the first word with the given *Suffix*.
* **L** - Asks for the last word with the given *Suffix*.
* **N** - Asks for the total number of words with the given *Suffix*.

The *Suffix* will have a length between 1 and 250 (inclusive) and it will be
completely in lowercase letters.

## Output ##

For each test case, print the case number in one line. Then, for every
query, print its answer in a single line. If the query type is **F** or
**L** and it can be answered with a valid word, print the word in lowercase
letters. If no word with the given *Suffix* was found in the text, print a
single asterisk symbol (__*__).
